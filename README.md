# Restaurant-Management-System

A fully responsive website for a restaurant, enabling users to seamlessly interact with the business online. This comprehensive project included features such as online food ordering, table reservations, and detailed menu displays. For the frontend, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. This ensures that customers can access the website comfortably whether they are using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. The backend of the website was built using PHP and SQL, providing robust functionality to manage user interactions and database operations. PHP was used to handle server-side logic, such as processing orders, managing user sessions, and handling table bookings. SQL was employed to manage the restaurant's database, storing essential information like menu items, customer orders, reservation details, and user accounts securely and efficiently.
